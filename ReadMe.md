#Short Description

This is a prototype app for classroom teachers.  It allows teachers to:

-   Create a model of their classroom using shapes to represent desks or chairs.  
-   Tap in an empty part of the classroom space to create a piece of furniture
-   Drag or rotate each piece of furniture to its correct place in the classroom
-   Drag students labels onto individual desks or chairs to associate the students with that item in the classroom
-   Drag markers onto an occupied desk or chair to keep track of how many times each student has been called on or asked a question.  
-   Turn on the video option to see live video of the classroom. 
-   Use the transform option to do a 3D perspective transform of the classroom layout that they've created in order to better match it with the video of their classroom.  

#Known Issues

- If you drag a "called on" or "question marker" onto the classroom area and miss, it becomes stranded and doesn't return to the control area.
- The 3D transform is an ugly hack, and currently cuts off the bottom half of the classroom space.
- After dragging a desk or chair, sometimes the drag doesn't clear the "active fixture".  This causes the same desk to chair to move when you try to drag a student from the student list onto one of the classroom fixtures (the student doesn't move)
- This is quick-and-dirty hackathon code that was written starting around 5:00pm on Friday, July 22, 2016 and then presented at 2:00pm on the following Sunday, July 24, 2016.  It is not polished, production-ready code, but it is a fun hack that might give you some ideas.

#iOSDevCamp

iOSDevCamp is a fun and inexpensive hackathon, usually held once a year in the San Jose area.  People of all ages and skill levels are able to come and join a team or work on their own in order to create special projects and show them to the other members of the camp.
